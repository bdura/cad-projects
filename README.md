# CAD projects

A collections of simple projects made with [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/).

Projects:

- [jar-lid fly trap](projects/flytrap.scad)
- [aquaponics siphon](projects/siphon.scad)
- some [ShopVac](https://www.printables.com/model/461256-shopvac-50mm-camlock-connectors-with-magnetic-catc) adaptors:
  - [extension (male-male adaptor)](projects/shopvac/extension.scad)
  - [tube adaptor](projects/shopvac/tube_adaptor.scad)

## Dependencies

Some of these projects use the following dependencies:

- [Round-Anything](https://github.com/Irev-Dev/Round-Anything/)
- [BOSL2](https://github.com/BelfrySCAD/BOSL2/)

I personally just `git clone` the relevant project in OpenSCAD's well-known library directory
(`$HOME/Documents/OpenSCAD/libraries` on macOS, `$HOME/.local/share/OpenSCAD/libraries` on Linux)
and call it a day. I checked out the latest release for Round-Anything for good measure.
